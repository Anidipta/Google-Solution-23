### Our Theme ${\color{green}AQI \space : \space World's \space Climate \space Through \space Your \space Lens }$
-**Introduction:**
In a world threatened by air pollution, understanding air quality is crucial. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool, offering insights into pollution levels and associated health risks.

-**Exploration of AQI Components:**
AQI measures various pollutants like particulate matter, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, explaining their sources and health effects.

-**Calculation and Interpretation:**
The methodology behind AQI calculation, pollutant weighting, and category implications, ranging from "Good" to "Hazardous," is crucial for public health awareness.

-**Data Collection and Monitoring:**
Examining AQI data sources, including government agencies, monitoring stations, and satellite observations, highlights the need for real-time monitoring and data transparency.

-**Global Perspectives:**
Comparing AQI systems worldwide reveals insights into cultural, geographical, and regulatory factors affecting air quality management and international cooperation.

-**Health Impacts and Mitigation Strategies:**
The health consequences of exposure to various AQI levels, coupled with effective mitigation strategies like emission controls and urban planning, underscore the importance of AQI.

-**Empowering Public Awareness:**
AQI plays a critical role in raising public awareness about air pollution through educational initiatives, community engagement, and digital platforms.

-**Case Studies and Future Outlook:**
Illustrative city and regional success stories demonstrate the impact of measures to improve air quality, offering insights into future trends in air quality management.

Conclusion:
As we strive for clean air for future generations, AQI's significance in fostering global collaboration and prioritizing public health cannot be overstated, ensuring a healthier, more sustainable world.

### ${\color{green}SDGs \space We \space Addressed}$
- **11** Sustainable Cities and Communities
- **13** Climate action
- **15** Life On Land
 
### SDGs We Addressed
<details open><summary><b>Sustainable Cities and Communities (11)</b></summary>
  
The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. It targets issues such as access to adequate housing, sustainable transport, green spaces, and slum upgrading. The goal also emphasizes the importance of reducing the environmental impact of cities, including air pollution and waste management. 
</details>
<details><summary><b>Climate action (13)</b></summary>
  SDG 13 focuses on urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. It emphasizes the need for countries to strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters. This goal also highlights the importance of integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning.
</details>
<details><summary><b>Life On Land (15)</b></summary>
  SDG 15, Life on Land, aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, emphasizing the importance of biodiversity conservation and combating land degradation.
In our project, we leverage image processing technology to monitor and assess the impact of human activities on terrestrial ecosystems, aligning with SDG 15's goals of sustainable land use and biodiversity preservation.
